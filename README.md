# Welcome to hornhelp!

If you have met me, you know that I have my background in Music Education. As soon as COVID-19 caused the schools to shut down, there was a gap of web-based apps that I could use to help my students continue learning remotely. My goal with hornhelp is to create a place for students and teachers to continue their learning in terms of Brass Education.

## Goals

- What I have in mind for the future includes a blog for some quick-reading articles that can be easily digested for learners. It's also another reason for me to keep in touch with the amazing educators I have met throughout my teaching career and have them contribute to the blog. Although this is a React-based site, I will be using Angular for the blog to get that exercise and practice with a different framework.

- Another goal of mine is to create an app that students can use to improve their memorization of instrument fingerings. Something as customizable as what is seen on [musictheory.net](https://www.musictheory.net/exercises/note).

- Finally, I think it would be a cool challenge to take on developing a scheduling app where students and parents can log in and schedule private lessons.
